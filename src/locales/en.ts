                    This is skin in the game, but the number reported here is

                    delegated (as of March 2021) but will be 25% within a month.
                    If you find skin in the game important, I recommend reaching
                    out to the validator to ask them the accurate number they have

                  This is currently the only way a validator makes money and it
                  comes out of rewards. For example, at a rate of commission at
                  5% and a reward of 1 Luna, a delegator would receive .95 Luna
                  and the validator would receive .05 Luna. Luna Orbit utilizes
                  enterprise grade hosting that should ensure maximum
                  reliability and performance but it comes at a cost. Delegators
                  must decide if reliability and performance is important to
                  them or if lower cost validators are worth the risk.

                  This is the current annual return you can expect from staking
                  with this validator. Keep in mind that validators that are new
                  (less than 30 days) might show different actual rates. This
                  does not mean that a new delegator making 12% is better than
                  an established validator making 8%, it just means the returns
                  have gone up recently and the numbers fail to fairly represent
                  the true picture for delegation return. However - Do Kwon has
                  said that oracle performance will have a major impact on
                  delegation returns so pay attention to the performance of your
                  validators at this website (Look at http://terra.stake.id and
                  check the column "Missed Oracle Votes" to get an idea of
                  performance).

                  This might be the most important on the list, you want the
                  maximum amount of uptime. Anything less can lead to small
                  penalties "slashing" to "jailing" . A small penalty is .01%
                  while jailing would cut off rewards until you redelegate or
                  the node fixes the issues. You want to choose a node that is
                  reliable if you want good uptime.

                  Some validators are active in the community and help people
                  out, some are building useful tools, some are high end for
                  reliability, and some people just want to make sure they
                  support the smaller validators in order to decentralize. There
                  could be any number of reasons to choose particular validators
                  and they all have an incentive to help you and the Terra eco
